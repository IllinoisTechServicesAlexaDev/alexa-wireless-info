  Welcome to the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign quiet space information skill,
  using wireless connection info to determine the busyness of a building on campus.
  How can I help you? If you'd like more information on what I can do, say "help".

help: |
  I can provide information about wireless connections in various buildings here at the university. 
  I can also tell you how many total wireless access points and client devices are connected to these points. 
  To start a query, just tell me the building name. 
  For example, if want to know the wireless information for Illini Union, just say "Illini Union". 
  Then, say "start" to initiate the query. 
  Or, you can say "which buildings are busy", and I will tell you the names of busy buildings. 
  Finally, you can say "stop" or "goodbye" to end this session.

confirm-clue: |
  Got it, {{ which_name }} {{ name }}. Say "start" or "begin" to initiate the query.

answer-results: |
  There are a total of {{ result["totalAP"] }} wireless access points, and {{ result["clientdevices"] }} client devices connected to these points, at {{ result["buildingname"] }}. 
  Anything else?

answer-busy-results: |
  The following buildings are currently busy: {{ result }}. 
  
answer-mostly-connection: |
  The top 1 building is {{ result[0] }} which has {{ result[1] }} connection, The top 2 building is {{ result[2] }} which has {{ result[3] }} connection, the top 3 building is {{ result[4] }} which has {{ result[5] }} connection. 

answer-noresults: |
  I'm sorry, but I don't know a building that matches that query. 
  You can start another query now, or say "stop" to end this session.

error-not-understand: |
  I'm sorry, but I couldn't understand that. Could you say it again?

error-other: |
  I'm sorry, but I am experiencing an error. Please try again.

goodbye: Goodbye. Thank you for using University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign wireless checker.
